We are constantly managing and altering the environment to produce food, allow for development, create opportunities for recreation, and restore ecological communities. For example, we apply fertilizers to help crops grow, introduce plants for erosion control, and use herbicides to control invasive plants. Plants are involved in numerous ecological interactions that form the basis of our ecosystems. Yet, it is unclear how some of the unintended consequences of management activities affect plant ecology.

**What I study:**
- How do fertilizers alter plant microbes?
- How do invasive plants facilitate disease emergence?
- How do herbicides affect lakes?

**About**

I am an ecologist and data scientist in the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences at the University of Florida. I use long-term monitoring data, experiments, and models in R to address questions about how management activities can alter ecological interactions in plant communities. Check out my [projects]({{< ref "project/">}}) to learn more about my approaches and collaborators!

Coding and statistics have been key tools throughout my research career and I am passionate about making them more accessible others. As a teaching assistant, a volunteer for Girls Who Code, and now a co-organizer of [R-Ladies Gainesville](https://www.meetup.com/rladies-gainesville/), I have created exercises and tutorials for new and experienced coders. Check out the [tutorials page]({{< ref "courses/" >}}) for instructional materials!
