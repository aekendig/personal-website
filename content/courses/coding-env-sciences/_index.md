This workshop combines data collection with coding for students to gain hands-on experience with environmental science research. Other learning goals include an introduction to research taking place at a local university and introduction or review of basic ecology concepts. The workshop took place at Cedar Creek Ecosystem Science Reserve in East Bethel, MN in 2017 and at the University of Florida in Gainesville, FL in 2019. The materials in this [Github repo](https://github.com/aekendig/CodingEnvSci_UF_FieldTrip) are from the University of Florida workshop. The science curriculum involves data collection from a field experiment and greenhouse experiment. The coding curriculum involves an introduction to R and analysis of the collected data in R. Please contact me if you'd like to develop a similar workshop for your research.
