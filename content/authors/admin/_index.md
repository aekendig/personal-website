**What I study:**
- How do herbicides affect lakes?
- How do invasive species facilitate disease emergence?
- How do fertilizers alter plant microbes?

**About**

I am a postdoctoral researcher in the Institute of Food and Agricultural Sciences at the University of Florida. I tackle questions about how human impacts on the environment, such as species introductions and nutrient inputs, affect terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems. I focus on plant communities and infectious diseases. I use long-term monitoring data, experiments, and models in R.
